# Project-5

•	Read a line of text
•	Convert the text to all uppercase
•	Replace everything except the letters A-Z with a space: “I-Can’t!” becomes “I CAN T”
•	The spaces will now be assumed to delimit words
•	Count each word by
    o	If it is not already in a hash table, add it
    o	Otherwise, add one to the number of times this word has been seen
•	Repeat to end of file

•	Sorted the hash table using a Java TreeMap (red-black tree)
•	Using an iterator, print each word and the count of how many times it occurred, one per line in alphabetical order.
